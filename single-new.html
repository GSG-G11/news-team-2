                    Crowds watched solemnly as the body of Rep. John Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge one final
                    time,

                    horse-drawn caisson Sunday at the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church. From there, the
                    public were allowed to line up to honor Lewis for about a half-mile to the foot of the bridge.

                    Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Al., thanked Lewis’ family during a ceremony at the chapel for sharing the

                    Crowds waited for Lewis’ body at the foot of the bridge, where he was met by Alabama state troopers,

                    safely escorted him across and on to the state capitol.

                    leaves
                    behind and the lives that he changed,” Sewell said. "It’s poetic justice that this time, Alabama

                    troopers will see John to his safety. "

                    As the horse-drawn caisson approached the bridge, those in the masses on the sidewalk could be heard
                    singing for Lewis. In an emotional moment, the voices stopped as Lewis' casket began to make its way
                    across the bridge in silent reverence.

                    The 16-term lawmaker, often called the conscience of Congress, was a giant of the civil rights
                    movement
                    of the 1960s. Lewis was only 25 when he believed Alabama troopers would kill him on the peaceful
                    march
                    for voting rights across the bridge on March 7, 1965, known today as “Bloody Sunday.”

                    Lewis suffered a fractured skull and was one of dozens of nonviolent protesters who were
                    hospitalized.
                    News coverage of the brutal beatings prompted increased pressure on Congress to pass the 1965 Voting
                    Rights Act, to bar states from enforcing discriminatory laws that had long hindered prospective
                    Black
                    voters.
